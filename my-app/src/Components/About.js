      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p className="abtp">
        Our fashion Hub is a passion driven thrift business<br></br>
        It started off when a lady went thrifting her own pants for the
        semester, she bought like five pieces at a fair prices<br></br>
        Some pants were not fitting her but she bought them anyway because they
        had a great fabric and the design was super<br></br>
        Since she got really nice pants and did not want to leave them, she took
        them then sold the three pieces to her friends at a fair price<br></br>
        This very thing brought up the idea of ThriFThUB.Co<br></br>
